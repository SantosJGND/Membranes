## Membrane identification.

**Project description**: given transect information drawn from microscopy photographs of singe cells, 
extract intensity values of cell membranes. 

**Details**: Transects are transversal cuts of cell. Membranes can be assumed to run approximately parallel to each other. Cytoplasm interference is expected. Black background, artifacts also expected.

#### Attempt 1: using transects.
